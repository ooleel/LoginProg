# LoginProg

A foundational login system application available in two implementations: one in Python for simplicity and ease of understanding, and a more advanced version in C# to demonstrate scalable and robust design principles.

### Features:
- Two Versions:
  - *Python*: A beginner-friendly implementation focusing on core authentication concepts and user input validation.
  - *C#*: A more advanced version with enhanced functionality, better scalability, and adherence to industry standards.
- User Authentication: Verifies user credentials securely and efficiently.
- Input Validation: Prevents invalid or malicious data through robust validation mechanisms.
- Modular Design: Both versions are structured for easy extension, supporting features like user registration and password recovery.
- Lightweight and Adaptable: Suitable for standalone use or integration into larger systems.

This project highlights proficiency in Python and C# programming, showcasing an evolution from basic to advanced application development while addressing real-world authentication requirements.
